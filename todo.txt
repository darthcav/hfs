- Merge the pysof work

- Modify fhir_gen to add Rust docs to r4.rs, others.

- FHIRPath
  - FHIRPath Lab Debugger support

- SQL On FHIR
  - Support the group parameter
  - Submit here:  https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2?tab=readme-ov-file#registering-your-implementation

- My CapabilityStatement for $run needs help - name, and unsure about operation vs. resource

- Test to see if invalid attributes in the FHIR JSON model are allowed/disallowed?


- Manually added ViewDefinition Structure Definition to profiles-resources.json (deleting integer64) for generating r4.rs.  Need to also add it to the others except for r6 (anticipating a ViewDefinition resource to be added to r6) (and adding back in integer64)
