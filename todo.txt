- Re-think skip-r6-download feature - it seems to be on all the time now.
- Setup local cache for builds - need to move runners

- FHIRPath
  - Add R6 support in fhirpath-lab.com
  - FHIRPath Lab Debugger support

- SQL On FHIR
  - Make test_results.json available 
  - Submit here:  https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2?tab=readme-ov-file#registering-your-implementation
  - Implement the new repeat feature
  - Support the group parameter

- My CapabilityStatement for $run needs help - name, and unsure about operation vs. resource

- Test to see if invalid attributes in the FHIR JSON model are allowed/disallowed?


- Manually added ViewDefinition Structure Definition to profiles-resources.json (deleting integer64) for generating r4.rs.  Need to also add it to the others except for r6 (anticipating a ViewDefinition resource to be added to r6) (and adding back in integer64)
