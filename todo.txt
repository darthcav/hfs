- Make repo public
  - Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file

- We are using two different versions of axum and axum-test - can we consolodiate to one?  Are there other duplicate crates with different versions?

- Process on a pile of JSON

- My CapabilityStatement for $run needs help - name, and unsure about operation vs. resource

- Modify fhir_gen to add Rust docs to r4.rs, others.

- Manually added ViewDefinition Structure Definition to profiles-resources.json (deleting integer64) for generating r4.rs.  Need to also add it to the others except for r6 (anticipating a ViewDefinition resource to be added to r6) (and adding back in integer64)

- Added fhirVersion to constant_types.json
